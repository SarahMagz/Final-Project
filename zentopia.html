    	<h3>History</h3>

	    <p>Zentopia was developed to save human kind and remaining creatures left on earth. Hundreds og years ago humans slowly destroyed earth as a paradise. Hundreds of scientists and delevopers have been working on making March a livable planet. We are provdly announcing the first city livable on March.</p>

	    <p> Welcome to Zentopia – first livable city on March.</p>



	<!-- Zentopia -->

		<h3>Zentopia</h3>

		<p>Located on the Amazonis quadrangle, close to the the Martian equator, lies Zentopia. Zentopia is a highly modern and advanced city, functioning as a safe-space for our refugees from Earth. The city itself is divided into multiple quarters, each matching the different continents and cultures from Earth. The city center functions as a big melting pot, binding all of these cultures together and exposing them to one another. </p>

		<h4>Landing</h4>
		<p>There are seven landing platforms located outside the city, one for each continent. Within a short time after arrival, you will be transported to the city thanks to our highly intelligent, self-driven buggy-cars.</p>

		<p>When you first set your feet on Mars, you will soon come to realize that it’s not that different from this home after all. Thanks to our breakthrough technologies, we’ve managed to terraform the Red Planet into a place of wonders. </p>


		<!--Illustrasjon av Ohala Layer-->
		<h4>Ohala-layer</h4>
		<p>The Ohala-layer on March is our key to sucess. The Ohala-layer recreates the same effect as the greenhouse effect we know from Earth. Together with regulating temperature, it also regulates the gravity. Wich regulates the temperature between 15 to 40 degrees. </p>

		<!-- Illustrasjon av sims (ting å gjøre) -->
		<h4>Things to do</h4>
		<p>Zentopia welcomes you with a place to live, and a job specifically tailored to your best abilities. In your free time time, you could visit one of our multiple stores, parks or museums. You could share a Martian Stirring Pot with your friends at Marn in Downtown Zentopia, take a stroll in the exotic Zingen-park, visit the Planet Tower or enjoy a take-away coffee from one of the multiple Coffa-shops around town. </p>
