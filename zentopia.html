            <h1>Location</h1>
            <p>Located on the Amazonis quadrangle, close to the the Martian equator, lies Zentopia. Zentopia is a highly modern
                and advanced city, functioning as a safe-space for our refugees from Earth. The city itself is divided into
                multiple quarters, each matching the different continents and cultures from Earth. The city center functions
                as a big melting pot, binding all of these cultures together and exposing them to one another.
            </p>
            <p>
                Zentopia is a place where you are able to enjoy a tropical environment for the rest of your life. The climate is made by
                pure advanced NASA technology. It is therefore possible to grow all kinds of fruit and vegetables all year
                round. The green scenery makes the air feel fresh and clean. The landscape varies from where you are located
                in Zentopia. Some locations can remind you of the beautiful beaches on the Maldives, green scenarios of the
                forest in Hawaii or the modern city of Singapore.

            <h1>Landing</h1>
            <p>There are seven landing platforms located outside the city, one for each continent. Within a short time after
                arrival, you will be transported to the city thanks to our highly intelligent, self-driven buggy-cars.

            <p>When you first set your feet on Mars, you will soon come to realize that it’s not that different from your old
                home after all. Thanks to our breakthrough technologies, we’ve managed to terraform the Red Planet into a
                place of wonders.
