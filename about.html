			<h2 class="top">About us</h2>
            <p>GoToMars Inc. started as a small company with a big dream in 2017.
                After years of research and planning we finally became partners with
                NASA in 2081. With all that has happened on Earth, we are proud to have
                helped as many as we could, and we still strive to send as many as we can to Mars.
            </p>
			<h2>Why Zentopia</h2>
			<p>Zentopia was developed to save human kind and the remaining creatures left on earth.

            Hundreds of years ago humans slowly destroyed earth as a paradise. Hundreds of
            scientists and delevopers have been working on making Mars a habitable planet.
			<br><br>
			The earth we live on today is over 4 and a half billion years old and Mars is in such good
			condition that it's expected to last twice as long. Maybe even longer if we dont make the same mistakes as on Earth.
			Technology of the future will make life on new planets possible and now you have the opportunity to take part
			in the first project of its kind ever! <br><br>

<<<<<<< HEAD:why.html
			Save your genes and your family by taking this opportunity to be part of something big! 
			A new world will be open to you in a safe and controlled setting, where the conditions are as close to earth as you can get.
