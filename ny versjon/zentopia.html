				Zentopia was developed to save human kind and remaining creatures left on earth. 
				Hundreds og years ago humans slowly destroyed earth as a paradise. Hundreds of 
				scientists and delevopers have been working on making March a livable planet. 
				We are provdly announcing the first city livable on March.
				Welcome to Zentopia – first livable city on March.
				
				Zentopia
				Located on the Amazonis quadrangle, close to the the Martian equator, lies Zentopia.
				Zentopia is a highly modern and advanced city, functioning as a safe-space for our refugees
				from Earth. The city itself is divided into multiple quarters, each matching the different 
				continents and cultures from Earth. The city center functions as a big melting pot, binding all 
				of these cultures together and exposing them to one another.
				
				Landing
				There are seven landing platforms located outside the city, one for each continent. Within a short 
				time after arrival, you will be transported to the city thanks to our highly intelligent, self-driven buggy-cars.
				
				Ohala-layer
				The Ohala-layer on is our key to sucess. The layer recreates the greenhouse effect we know from Earth and 
				regulates temperature and gravity. Even though Mars is further away from the sun, the temperature will always stay
				between 15 to 40 degrees.
				
				Things to do
				The city of Zentopia welcomes you with a place to live, and a job specifically tailored to your best abilities. 
				In your free time time, you could visit one of our multiple stores, parks or museums. You could share a Martian Stirring 
				Pot with your friends at Marn in Downtown Zentopia, take a stroll in the exotic Zingen-park, visit the Planet Tower or enjoy
				a take-away coffee from one of the multiple Coffa-shops around town.

				Welcome to Zentopia – first livable city on March.
