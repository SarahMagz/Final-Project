            <section>
                <h2>Location</h2>
                <p>Located on the Amazonis quadrangle, close to the the Martian equator,
                    lies Zentopia. Zentopia is a highly modern and advanced city, functioning
                    as a safe-space for our refugees from Earth. The city itself is divided into
                    multiple quarters, each matching the different continents and cultures
                    from Earth. The city center functions as a big melting pot, binding all
                    of these cultures together and exposing them to one another.
                </p>

                <h2>Landing</h2>
                <p>There are seven landing platforms located outside the city,
                    one for each continent. Within a short time after arrival,
                    you will be transported to the city thanks to our highly intelligent,
                    self-driven buggy-cars.

                <p>When you first set your feet on Mars, you will soon come to realize that
                    it’s not that different from your old home after all. Thanks to our breakthrough
                    technologies, we’ve managed to terraform the Red Planet into a place of wonders.

                <h2 class="orangeBox">Ohala-layer</h2>
                <p>The Ohala-layer is our key to success. The layer recreates the greenhouse
                    effect we know from Earth and regulates temperature and gravity. Even though Mars
                    is further away from the sun, the temperature will always stay between 15 to 40 degrees celcius.

                <p>Zentopia was developed to save human kind and the remaining creatures left on earth.
                    Hundreds of years ago humans slowly destroyed earth as a paradise. Hundreds of
                    scientists and delevopers have been working on making Mars a habitable planet.
                    We are proudly announcing the first livable city on Mars.
                </p>
                <h2 class="orangeBox">Things to do</h2>
                <p>The city of Zentopia welcomes you with a place to live, and a job specifically
                    tailored  to your best abilities. In your spare time, you could visit one of our
                    multiple stores, parks or museums. You could share a Martian Stirring Pot
                    with your friends at Marn in Downtown Zentopia, take a stroll in the exotic
                    Zingen-park, visit the Planet Tower or enjoy a take-away coffee from one of
                    the multiple Coffa-shops around town.
