                <!-- Zentopia -->
                <h4>Location</h4>
                <p>Located on the Amazonis quadrangle, close to the the Martian equator, 
                    lies Zentopia. Zentopia is a highly modern and advanced city, functioning 
                    as a safe-space for our refugees from Earth. The city itself is divided into 
                    multiple quarters, each matching the different continents and cultures 
                    from Earth. The city center functions as a big melting pot, binding all 
                    of these cultures together and exposing them to one another.
                </p>

                <h4>Landing</h4>
                <p>There are seven landing platforms located outside the city, 
                    one for each continent. Within a short time after arrival, 
                    you will be transported to the city thanks to our highly intelligent, 
                    self-driven buggy-cars.
                </p>

                <p>When you first set your feet on Mars, you will soon come to realize that 
                    it’s not that different from this home after all. Thanks to our breakthrough 
                    technologies, we’ve managed to terraform the Red Planet into a place of wonders.

                <h4>Ohala-layer</h4>
                <p>The Ohala-layer on is our key to sucess. The layer recreates the greenhouse 
                    effect we know from Earth and regulates temperature and gravity. Even though Mars 
                    is further away from the sun, the temperature will always stay between 15 to 40 degrees.

                <p>Zentopia was developed to save human kind and remaining creatures left on earth. 
                    Hundreds og years ago humans slowly destroyed earth as a paradise. Hundreds of 
                    scientists and delevopers have been working on making March a livable planet. 
                    We are provdly announcing the first city livable on March.
                </p>

                    tailored  to your best abilities. In your free time time, you could visit one of our
