        <!-- Historien -->
        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>Zentopia was developed to save human kind and remaining 
            bcreatures left on earth. Hundreds og years ago humans slowly 
            destroyed earth as a paradise. Hundreds of scientists and 
            delevopers have been working on making March a livable planet. 
            We are proudly announcing the first city livable on March.
        </p>
        <p> Welcome to Zentopia – first livable city on March.</p>
            
        <!-- Zentopia -->
        <h3>Zentopia</h3>
        <p>Located on the Amazonis quadrangle, close to the the Martian equator, 
            lies Zentopia. Zentopia is a highly modern and advanced city, functioning 
            as a safe-space for our refugees from Earth. The city itself is divided into 
            multiple quarters, each matching the different continents and cultures 
            from Earth. The city center functions as a big melting pot, binding all 
            of these cultures together and exposing them to one another.
        </p>

        <h4>Landing</h4>
        <p>There are seven landing platforms located outside the city, 
            one for each continent. Within a short time after arrival, 
            you will be transported to the city thanks to our highly intelligent, 
            self-driven buggy-cars.
        </p>

        <p>When you first set your feet on Mars, you will soon come to realize that 
            it’s not that different from this home after all. Thanks to our breakthrough 
            technologies, we’ve managed to terraform the Red Planet into a place of wonders.

        <h4>Ohala-layer</h4>
        <p>The Ohala-layer on March is our key to sucess. The Ohala-layer recreates 
            the same effect as the greenhouse effect we know from Earth. Together 
            with regulating temperature, it also regulates the gravity. Wich regulates 
            the temperature between 15 to 40 degrees.
