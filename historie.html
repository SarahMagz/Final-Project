                <p>Located on the Amazonis quadrangle, close to the the Martian equator,
                    lies Zentopia. Zentopia is a highly modern and advanced city, functioning
                    as a safe-space for our refugees from Earth. The city itself is divided into
                    multiple quarters, each matching the different continents and cultures
                    from Earth. The city center functions as a big melting pot, binding all
                    of these cultures together and exposing them to one another.

                    it’s not that different from this home after all. Thanks to our breakthrough

                <p>Zentopia was developed to save human kind and remaining creatures left on earth.
                    Hundreds og years ago humans slowly destroyed earth as a paradise. Hundreds of
                    scientists and delevopers have been working on making March a livable planet.
                    We are provdly announcing the first city livable on March.
